## Overview

This document captures the monitoring patterns, challenges, and manual processes involved in tracking GitHub Actions workflows during CI/CD testing and validation.

## Most Frequent Monitoring Operations

### 1. Workflow Run Status (Constantly)
```bash
gh run list --limit 5                    # Check latest runs
gh run view {run_id}                     # View specific run details
gh run watch                             # Real-time monitoring (when available)
```

**What I'm checking:**
- Did the workflow trigger successfully?
- Is it still running or stuck?
- Did it complete? Pass or fail?
- Which jobs/steps failed?

### 2. Job Progress Within Workflows
- Which job is currently executing
- How long each job is taking
- Are jobs running in parallel as expected?
- Matrix job status (e.g., Python 3.11 vs 3.12 vs 3.13)

### 3. Step-Level Details
- Which specific step failed
- Error messages and stack traces
- Command outputs
- Artifact generation

### 4. Performance Metrics
- **Duration**: Is this run slower than usual?
- **Queue time**: How long before it started?
- **Resource usage**: Runner availability
- **Cache hits/misses**: Is caching working?

### 5. Test Results & Coverage
- Test pass/fail rates
- Coverage percentages
- Which specific tests failed
- Performance test results

### 6. Security Scan Results
- Vulnerability findings
- Security score changes
- New CVEs detected
- Compliance status

## The Monitoring Challenge

The real challenge is that I have to:

1. **Poll repeatedly** - No real-time push notifications
2. **Parse text output** - Extracting structured data from CLI output
3. **Track state mentally** - Remember what I'm waiting for across multiple runs
4. **Coordinate multiple workflows** - When testing matrix builds or comparisons
5. **Aggregate results** - Compile results from multiple runs/jobs

## Mental State Machine

What I'm really doing is maintaining a state machine in my head:

```
         ┌──────────┐
         │ Triggered │
         └─────┬─────┘
               │
               ▼
         ┌──────────┐
      ┌──│  Queued  │──┐
      │  └──────────┘  │
      │                │ timeout
      │ picked up      ▼
      │           ┌─────────┐
      ▼           │ Timeout │
 ┌──────────┐     └─────────┘
 │ Running  │
 └─────┬────┘
       │
   ┌───┼────┐
   │   │    │
   ▼   ▼    ▼
┌────┐┌────┐┌──────┐
│Pass││Fail││Cancel│
└────┘└────┘└──────┘
   │    │      │
   └────┼──────┘
        ▼
   ┌─────────┐
   │ Analyze │
   └─────────┘
```

## Common Monitoring Patterns

### Pattern 1: Test Triggering & Verification
```bash
# What I do manually:
gh workflow run test.yml              # Trigger
sleep 5                               # Wait for it to appear
gh run list --limit 1                 # Did it start?
# (repeat until I see it running)
```

### Pattern 2: Parallel Run Monitoring
```bash
# When testing matrix builds, I monitor multiple runs:
for run in $(gh run list --json databaseId -q '.[].databaseId' --limit 3); do
    echo "Run $run: $(gh run view $run --json status -q .status)"
done
```

### Pattern 3: Failure Investigation
```bash
# When something fails:
gh run view {run_id} --log-failed     # Get failure logs
gh run download {run_id}              # Get artifacts for debugging
gh run view {run_id} --json jobs      # Which jobs failed?
```

### Pattern 4: Performance Comparison
```bash
# Comparing old vs new workflow:
OLD_RUN=$(gh run list --workflow=old-ci.yml --limit 1 --json databaseId -q '.[0].databaseId')
NEW_RUN=$(gh run list --workflow=new-ci.yml --limit 1 --json databaseId -q '.[0].databaseId')

# Then repeatedly check both:
echo "Old: $(gh run view $OLD_RUN --json status,conclusion)"
echo "New: $(gh run view $NEW_RUN --json status,conclusion)"
```

## What an Automated Monitor Would Track

```python
class WorkflowMonitor:
    """What I'm essentially doing manually"""

    def __init__(self):
        self.active_runs = {}
        self.completed_runs = {}
        self.metrics = {}

    def monitor_workflow(self, run_id: str):
        """Core monitoring loop I perform"""
        while True:
            status = self.check_status(run_id)

            # Track what I watch for:
            self.track_metrics({
                'current_status': status.state,           # queued/in_progress/completed
                'duration_so_far': status.elapsed_time,   # How long it's been running
                'jobs_completed': status.jobs_done,       # 3/5 jobs done
                'jobs_failed': status.failed_jobs,        # Any failures yet?
                'current_step': status.active_step,       # "Running tests..."
                'artifacts_created': status.artifacts,    # Build outputs ready?
                'logs_size': status.log_bytes,           # Unusual log growth?
            })

            # Decision points I face:
            if status.state == 'completed':
                return self.analyze_results(run_id)

            if status.elapsed_time > timeout:
                return self.handle_timeout(run_id)

            if status.failed_jobs > 0 and fail_fast:
                return self.handle_failure(run_id)

            time.sleep(30)  # Check every 30 seconds

    def analyze_results(self, run_id):
        """Post-completion analysis I do"""
        return {
            'success': all_jobs_passed(),
            'duration': total_time(),
            'bottlenecks': identify_slow_steps(),
            'failures': parse_error_messages(),
            'artifacts': download_artifacts(),
            'comparison': compare_with_baseline(),
        }
```

## What Makes This Tedious

1. **No push notifications** - I have to pull/poll constantly
2. **Multiple terminals** - Tracking different runs across windows
3. **Mental context switching** - Remember what each run is testing
4. **Timing coordination** - Some tests need sequential execution
5. **Result aggregation** - Manually compiling results from multiple runs
6. **Error investigation** - Diving into logs when failures occur
7. **Performance analysis** - Comparing run times and resource usage

## Pain Points in Current Workflow

### Information Scattered
- Run status in one command
- Job details in another
- Logs in yet another
- Artifacts downloaded separately

### No Historical Context
- Hard to compare current run with previous runs
- No baseline performance tracking
- Difficult to spot trends or regressions

### Limited Filtering
- Can't easily filter by specific criteria
- No way to group related runs
- Difficult to track test scenarios across runs

### Manual Correlation
- Manually tracking which runs belong to which test scenario
- Correlating matrix job results
- Comparing before/after optimization results

## Automation Opportunities

### Real-time Monitoring
```python
# What could be automated:
monitor = CIMonitor()
monitor.watch_workflow(
    repo="provide-io/ci-tooling",
    workflow="test-actions.yml",
    on_status_change=lambda status: notify_slack(status),
    on_failure=lambda run: investigate_failure(run),
    on_completion=lambda run: generate_report(run)
)
```

### Intelligent Analysis
```python
# Automated pattern recognition:
analyzer = WorkflowAnalyzer()
analysis = analyzer.analyze_run(run_id)

if analysis.performance_regression > 20:
    alert_team("Significant performance regression detected")

if analysis.flaky_test_detected:
    create_issue("Flaky test needs attention", analysis.details)

if analysis.suggests_optimization:
    suggest_improvements(analysis.recommendations)
```

### Aggregated Reporting
```python
# Automated reporting across multiple runs:
reporter = TestReporter()
report = reporter.generate_comprehensive_report([
    "matrix_test_run_123",
    "security_scan_run_124",
    "performance_test_run_125"
])

# Automatically post to PR or Slack
post_test_summary(report)
```

## Value of CI Orchestrator

This analysis shows why the CI orchestrator abstraction would be so valuable:

1. **Eliminates manual polling** - Automated monitoring with callbacks
2. **Aggregates distributed information** - Single view of all relevant data
3. **Provides historical context** - Baseline comparisons and trend analysis
4. **Intelligent alerting** - Only notify on significant changes
5. **Automated correlation** - Groups related runs and scenarios
6. **Performance insights** - Automatic bottleneck identification
7. **Failure analysis** - Automated root cause investigation

Instead of manually juggling multiple terminal windows and mental state, the orchestrator would handle all the monitoring, aggregation, and analysis automatically, letting me focus on interpreting results and making decisions rather than collecting data.

## Next Steps

This monitoring pattern analysis directly informs the design of the CI orchestrator:

1. **Real-time event streaming** instead of polling
2. **Unified dashboard** instead of scattered CLI outputs
3. **Intelligent notifications** instead of constant checking
4. **Automated analysis** instead of manual investigation
5. **Historical tracking** instead of point-in-time snapshots

The orchestrator essentially codifies and automates everything described in this document.
